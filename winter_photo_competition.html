    <h1>Winter Photo Competition</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>When everything was in-person, there were a lot of fun booths for the festival, including friendly competitions. As a replace for that, we have organized a winter photo competition! Take photos of you in winter with your family, pets, ect. Or, take photos of your surroundings, whether that means your backyard after a snowfall, or a view out a plane window. If you have multiple photos, make a video, full with content that you have taken. To submit, email winterfestival2022@gmail.com, with an attachment of your submission. Check out the <a href="./schedule.html">schedule page</a> to see when the competition ends and when the form will be sent out for people to vote about which submission is the best. The submissions that get the most, second-most, and third-most votes, will win a prize. Keep checking this page to see some recent submissions.</p>
    <p>Thank you to Tayler Hernandez, Kody Cross, Kiri Meadows, Alexis Rios, Maxime Weber, Payton Wolf, Kennedy Cullen, Yu Clemons, Lilith Foster, Harpreet Rowland, and Izzy Boyd for allowing us to put their photos on the website. You can see there photos below clockwise by the order they were listed.</p>
