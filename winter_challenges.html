    <h1>Winter Challenges</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Here are some activities to keep you from being bored, and to get you outside. When you finish a challenge, take a picture of what you did and email it to winterfestival2022@gmaild.com. If you finish all five challenges before the festival ends, you will get your name on the home page and maybe even a prize. Go to the <a href="./schedule.html">schedule Page</a> to see when the photos are due.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>For your first challenge, make a snowman! This classic task is arguably much harder then it seems. Start with two snowballs, and see if you can get it up to three! Never forget to add a smile and some personality on your snowman. After some practice, why don't you have a snowman-making battle with a friend? Make sure to do this activity in an open space, like a field, after a big snowstorm. If you master this, you can also make a snowfort, or build something else.</p></li>
      <li><p>For your second challenge, make a bingo board. First, go outside and try to jot down at least 9-15 things you see, hear, smell, or touch. Then, go inside and draw a bingo board with nine squares on it. Fill in the squares with what was on your list. After that, make another board, and repeat until you have a board for everyone who wants to play. Make sure each board has a different pattern, and if you found more than 9 things, don't use the same things on every board. Next, go outside! Search for the items on your board, and shout them out and mark them with a pencil when you find one. Don't tell anyone where you found it though! First person to get all squares filled out, (or whatever pattern you decided on) wins! You can do this with any size board you want.</p></li>
      <li><p>For your third challenge, make a sledding run! Find a hill nearby after it snows, or just use your backyard. Take a sled and try to make a track. Once your sled and others can run smoothly down it, try adding a jump. Experiment with turns and icey patches as you sled down. How fast can your sled go? How long can you make your track? What happens if you sled down backwards? When your sledding run is perfect, share it with your friends! How is it different in their sleds? Keep on adjusting to make it better.</p></li>
      <li><p>For your fourth challenge, after you go outside, make a drink to warm you up. Try making home-made hot cocoa, or boil some tea. Chammomile, Lavender, and fruit teas are great! Maybe get some instant hot apple cider, or another drink. Or, make a mug cake! There is a recipe on the <a href="./food.html">food page</a> for you to use, but you can always find and use your own.</p></li>
      <li><p>For your fifth and final challenge, try out a new winter sport. You could go to your local rink and try ice skating. If you like that, maybe you could take some lessons? Also, see if there is a ski/snowboarding mountain near by. If there isn't, that's okay, but if there is, try going and taking a lesson. Or, search up if you can rent cross-country skis anywhere, and try skiing on a easy trail. All of these sports will make sure that you are excercising in the snow.</p></li>
