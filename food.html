    <h1>Food</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>One of the highlights of festivals, are the local food stands and venders selling their goods. We aren't able to bring any food to you, so we decided to allow you to bring food to yourself. Here are some recipes that we think are easy enough for everyone to try at home. The first recipe is the easiest and the last is the hardest.</p>
    <h4>Recipe #1: Shortbread</h4>
      <p>Shortbread is a very easy and delicious thing to make, and perfect for parties or cookie swaps. A shortbread cookie uses a 1-2-3 ratio, so, one part sugar, two parts butter, and three parts flour. When you feel confident with the normal recipe, change it up! Add in lime, lemon or orange zest, to give a little punch. Dip half of it in chocolate. The possibilities are endless!</p>
      <h5>Ingredients</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter (1 stick)</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
      </ul>
    <h5>Instructions</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix until blended. Do not over mix.</li>
        <li>Take a tablespoon and scoop the dough into balls. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on a rack.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Have fun creating your own variations!</p>
    <h4>Recipe #2: Hot Chocolate</h4>
      <p>Hot chocolate is a family favorite and perfect indoors or out. Next time you feel the craving for this warm drink, try making it from scratch instead of using powder with our recipe.</p>
      <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
          <li>1/2 cup butterscotch morsels (optional)</li>
          <li>Mini marshmallows (optional)</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine the milk and half-and-half in a small pot and warm over medium heat. Do not boil.</li>
          <li>When mixture begins to simmmer, add in vanilla extract and mix together.</li>
          <li>Add in cocoa powder until completely blended into the mixture.</li>
          <li>Pour hot chocolate into mugs using a ladle.</li>
          <li>If you would like, add mini marshmallows into the mugs</li>
          <li>You can also mix in the butterscotch in step two until it is combined into the mixture.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
    <h4>Recipe #3: Nuts and Bolts</h4>
      <p>Nuts and Bolts is a harder recipe for more experienced chefs, so be prepared and read through the recipe first. Make this delicious appetizer for any time you have company over. This recipe is in bulk, so feel free to half the recipe.</p>
      <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>14 cups (2 cans) mixed nuts</li>
          <li>4 cups butter (8 sticks)</li>
          <li>2 small bags of pretzels</li>
          <li>5 cereals: Rice Chex, Wheat Chex, Corn Chex, Bran Chex, and Cheerios (If you need to substitute, don't use sweet cereal)</li>
          <li>10 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
          <li>19 teaspoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>In two roaster pans, on low heat, slowly warm 2 cups (4 sticks) of the butter with the garlic salt and Worcestershire Sauce in each pan. Wait until the garlic salt is mostly dissolved and the butter is melted in. Don't let it boil.</li>
          <li>Add 7 cups (1 can) of mixed nuts, 1 bag of pretzels, 2 1/2 cups of each of the cereals, and 1/2 of the melted butter mixture into each roaster pan. Mix well so all ingredients in each pan are coated.</li>
          <li>Put one pan on the upper rack of an oven and one pan on the lower rack.</li>
          <li>Bake at 250 degrees for at least 2 hours, or until the butter mixture is absorbed. (No butter is on the bottom of the pan.)</li>
          <li>Every 20 minutes, take each pan out, stir the ingredients and put the pans back in the oven on different racks. Make sure to rotate the pans every time.</li>
          <li>Last time you remove it from the oven, stir each pan one more time then let them cool.</li>
          <li>Store in airtight cans or plastic containers</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serve at any winter party!</p>
