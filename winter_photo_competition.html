    <h1>Winter Photo Competition</h1>
    <p>When everything was in-person, there were a lot of fun booths for the festival, including friendly competitions. As a replace for that, we have organized a winter photo competition! Take photos of you in winter with your family, pets, ect. Or, take photos of your surroundings, whether that means your backyard after a snowfall, or a view out a plane window. If you have multiple photos, make a video, full with content that you have taken. To submit, email winterfestival2022@gmail.com, with an attachment of your submission. Check out the <a href="./schedule.html">schedule page</a> to see when the competition ends. At the end of the festival, we will send out a form for people to vote about which submission is the best. The submissions that get the most, second-most, and third-most votes, will win a prize. Keep checking this page to see some recent submissions.</p>
